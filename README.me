A simple scraper for myBB forums that exports all posts to a postgres db.

myBB URLs look like this: https://myforum.com/Support/showthread.php?tid=33&page=2

This scraper simply iterates through every thread ID (tid) and then for each thread, iterates through every page. 

It saves the data into three postgres tables: 'posts', 'threads', and 'users'. 

If the forum requires authentication, authenticate with your browser, then copy the auth cookie and put it in the .env file. 

Installation and usage:

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
> python3 run_scraper.py

This was mostly coded with Aider and Deepseek.
